_Simple programming problems_

### What is this?
Let's solve the same problem in many different ways. We'll pick a simple coding challenge, then submit the solution, and discuss the code.

### How to submit your answer.

Fork this repo, create a directory with your name in the challenge's directory, then add the file(s) with your solution.

You can use any language you like, and there is absolutely no obligation to participate.

If there's enough interest we can discuss the different solutions during our department meetings.
